zutils.views.AddObjectXToObjectY:
    This is a class-based view that makes a few assumptions:
    * classx has a foreign key relationship to classy which uses the default related_name (ie 'classx_set')
    * probably more but I don't remember what right now
    __init__:
        required arguments:
            classx - A new instance of this class will be created
            classy - An existing instance of this class will have the classx object added to it
        optional arguments:
            form_class - if you don't want to use the default ModelForm for classx, supply a form here.
            login_required - if you want this view to be restricted to logged in users only, set this to True
